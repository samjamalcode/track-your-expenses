## Credits
### How did I get emojis üçî üè†:

- I'm on a Mac and there's a shortcut to open the Emoji keyboard (Ctrl + Cmd + Space). There's one for Windows too: Windows key + . (period) or Windows key + ; (semicolon).

- Emojis are just normal unicode characters to Python, so they will show up in VSCode or your terminal just as any other letter would!
